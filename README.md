## Overview

In Part 2 of the HBnB Evolution project, you will enhance your application by integrating a relational database using SQLAlchemy, an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), and by implementing security measures through JWT authentication. This phase aims to provide students with a real-world experience of upgrading an existing application to support more scalable and secure operations.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main layers:

1. **Services Layer**: Handles API requests and responses.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Processes and makes decisions based on the application's logic.
3. **Persistence Layer**: Manages data storage (currently file-based, moving to a database in the future).

### Key Entities

- **Places**: Representing rental locations with various attributes like name, description, address, etc.
- **Users**: Owners (hosts) or reviewers with attributes like email, password, first name, and last name.
- **Reviews**: User feedback and ratings for places.
- **Amenities**: Features of places such as Wi-Fi, pools, etc.
- **Country and City**: Each place is tied to a city, and each city belongs to a country.

### Business Logic Rules

- Unique Users: Each user is identified by a unique email.
- One Host per Place: Every place must have exactly one host.
- Flexible Hosting: A user can host multiple places or none.
- Open Reviewing: Users can write reviews for places they donâ€™t own.
- Amenity Options: Places can have multiple amenities from a catalog, and users can add new ones.
- City-Country Structure: A place belongs to a city, and each city belongs to a country.
